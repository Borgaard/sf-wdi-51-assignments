# Positioning Practice

## Instructions

1. Right now, the `nav` element scrolls with the rest of the page. Add styles to turn the `nav` into a "sticky" (or "fixed") 'nav.' 
	- Search for "Step 1" in the `style.css` file and write code for the sticky nav there.
2. Find `diag-1,` `diag-2,` and `diag-3` in your HTML file. We want these to serve as labels for different parts of the insect. Position each label within the `.bug-wrapper,` following the image in the section below as a guide.

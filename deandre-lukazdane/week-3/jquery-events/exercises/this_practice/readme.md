# Exercise Instructions

## Goal

To create an event listener that will print out the text content of a button when clicked. You must use `this` to accomplish...this.

## Instructions

## Hints

- You may need to look up a few helpful methods to use along with `$(this)` in the [jQuery docs](http://api.jquery.com/)... Some methods to keep an eye out for are listed below, but bear in mind that one might be best suited for the exercise.

	- `.html()`
	- `.text()`
	- `.contents()`
- Don't forget to make sure the document is ready before writing any of your JavaScript!

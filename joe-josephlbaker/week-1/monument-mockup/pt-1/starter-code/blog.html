        I just wanna die! Not today bitch! Not so fast Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty. Just you and me. And sometimes your sister, and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You wanna know why, Morty? Because he crossed me. It's been six hours. Dreams move one... one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So y'know, every day here is like a minute. It's like Inception, Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie.

        Cool. Just stay in the driveway; the kill-bots are live, and I took you off the whitelist. Principal Vagina here, don't let the name fool you; I'm very much in charge. Reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this, but if you have the flu, stay home. The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to Passover. What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is: Don't think about it. You know what a vole is, Morty? You know what a vole is?

        If I've learned one thing, it's that before you get anywhere in life, you gotta stop listening to yourself. Lookin' good! Isn't it obvious Morty? I froze him. Ohh yea, you gotta get schwifty.

        Not today bitch! Lick, lickity, lick my balls! God-damn! What are you looking at, mother fucker!

          <h3>Issue Twenty - The Southwest</h3>
          <p>We need a hang glider, and a crotch less uncle sam costume, and I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked red heads, and I want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father. That, out there. That's my grave. On one of our adventures Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world. So we bailed on that reality and we came to this one. Because in this one the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we were dead. So we came here a-a-and we buried ourselves and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast 2 What the fuck is going on?! Oh, I'm sorry Morty, are you the scientist or are you the kid who wanted to get laid?</p>

          <p>Holy crap, Morty, run! Run for your life, Morty, run! I-I've never seen that thing before in my life, Morty, I don't even know what the hell it is! We-we gotta get out of here, Morty, it's gonna kill us! We're gonna die, Morty! We're gonna die! The trick to cereal is keeping 70% of it above the milk. God-damn! Aw, c'mon Rick. That doesn't seem so bad. Are you hungry for apples? ARE YOU HUNGRY FOR APPLESSS!? Go home and drink, grandpa. If it were, you could call ME Ernest Hemingway. I mean, why would a poptart want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be like the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean? This is because you give Morty Smith bad grades, bitch! Rikitikitavi, bitch! You don't know me!</p>

One dot muthafucka! Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh yeah you can't. They blew up. Looossseeerrrrr. I love morty and i hope morty loves me. I want to wrap my arms around him and feel him deep inside me. Shut the fuck up about moonmen! Hi! Principal Vagina: the name's real, possibly Scandinavian. He's not a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's. This aftershave made women want me, but it also made me impotent! What are you looking at, mother fucker!</p>

# Let's Learn our State Capitals

We're going to create a game to help us memorize the names of the capitals of all 50 states.

To play the game:

 - Your program should prompt the user to identify the capital associated with a given state.
 - There should be running tallies on the number of correct and incorrect answers for each state
 - After getting through all 50 states one time, users should be asked whether or not they want to play again.

### Game Requirements

 - Make sure the states don't appear in alphabetical order in the prompts. This will make the game a bit more challenging for the user.

 - Provide a welcome message to introduce the player to the game.

 - Initialize new keys in the dictionaries that store the number of times a user gets a capital `correct` and the number of times the answer is `wrong`.

 - Through all 50 states, prompt the user to name the capital of the state.
  - If the answer is correct, display a message saying so, and increment the `correct` key.
  - If the answer is wrong, display a message saying so, and increment the `wrong` key.
  - After each prompt, display a message telling the reader how many times the state was answered correctly out of the total number of times answered.

- Once the user has gone through all 50 states, ask them if they'd like to play again.

## Getting Started

 You're given an array of dictionaries that contain each state name and capital.

 > **Hint**: For the purposes of developing this program, start with a test array of three dictionaries so you don't have to play through all 50 states each time.

### Potentially Useful Methods

- `print`
- `input`
- `for loop`
- `sorted`
- `random.shuffle()`

## Bonus!

- Calculate a overall total score, display a running tally for each prompt
- If the user plays again, set the order of how the prompts appear to start with the ones they got wrong the most often.
- Add a hint functionality that prints the first 3 letters of a capital

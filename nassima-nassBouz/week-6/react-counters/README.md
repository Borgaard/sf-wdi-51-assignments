# React Counters

By building this simple application, we'll explore the concepts of state, the differences between props and state and how we can change state from within a component using events.

To get started:

```sh
git clone git@git.generalassemb.ly:ga-wdi-exercises/react-counters.git
cd react-counters
npm install
npm run start
```

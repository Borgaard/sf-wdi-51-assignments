## Prerequisites

* Express
* Mongo
* Mongoose
* jQuery
* AJAX

## Exercise

We'll be building a full stack javascript app incrementally.

* At first it's going to be a list of **books**
* Then we'll add in **authors**
* Finally we'll embed **character** data in each book

#### [Sprint 1 - Mongoose](docs/sprint1.md)

Database Setup

#### [Sprint 2 - Reference & Populate](docs/sprint2.md)

Let's create an **author** model that gets referenced in the **book** model!

#### [Sprint 3 - Embedded](docs/sprint3.md)
Let's create a **character** model that gets embedded in the **book** model!

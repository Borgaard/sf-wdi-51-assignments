* Technologies Used:

  Bootstrap and jQuery were used to create the interactive elements on the page and default stylings.

* Process and Approach:

  First, I wireframed in class what I wanted my page to look like. Then, I built out a skeleton of the page's HTML with semantic HTML Tags. I prefer to build out functionality before styling.

  After I got the HTML in a way I wanted, I started to add in javaScript-based interactivity. I started with javascript that was included in Bootstrap to animate my navbar. Then, I used jQuery to create the scrolling effect and randomized quotes. Finally, I went back to Bootstrap 4 docs to make my carousel.

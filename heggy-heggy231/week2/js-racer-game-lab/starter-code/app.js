/*
[x] Start simple! Ask yourself what the MVP of this project is.
[] Create HTML and CSS files that create one red square div and one blue, lined up on the left side of the screen.
- Add a keydown event listener that console logs "blue move" or "red move."
- Replace that console log with JavaScript that moves the red or blue div a little to the right.
- A helpful jQuery method to look into: [offset()](http://api.jquery.com/offset/).
- Run with it from there!
- If you are stuck on a problem, use pseudocode to break it down into smaller, more solvable problems.
- If you need some ideas on where to start, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVSwX98kKFs).

# Sprint A - mongoDB & mongoose

## 1. You awake inside a new app and look around.

1. Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with your surroundings and navigate the file structure of this app.  You should see a few routes listed in `server.js`; a basic front-end using them, a few files in public including your front-end JavaScript.  
  > "Hmm", you think to yourself, "this app seems to be a books app."

1. Open up your browser and startup the server.  Take a look at the books on the front-end.
  > You didn't forget to `npm install` did you?

## 2. OK server.js, let's see what you've got?!

1. Open up `server.js` and take a look at the hard-coded books data.  You should see a list of book objects in there.
1. You should also already see that there are routes to create (POST) new books, get a list of books (GET index), get a single book (GET show) and edit and delete books.  -- Plus they're all using that array.  

## 3. Outgrowing Arrays as a datastore.

Array's are no longer adequate as a data-store.  They lose their data whenever the server is shut-down, they don't support backups unless you copy the file and new elements never get saved in the file.  Plus all the cool kids are using databases not arrays.

Let's replace that array with a database.  We'll create a booksSchema and Books model.  

First off let's setup mongo and mongoose.  

1. Install mongoose into this repo's package.json: `npm install --save mongoose`
1. Create a new file `models/book.js`

1. Our books will have the following attributes:
  * title
  * author
  * image (use a string for this)
  * releaseDate

  Let's create a schema using these properties.  I'll get you started:

  ```js
  var mongoose = require('mongoose');
  var Schema = mongoose.Schema;

  var BookSchema = new Schema({
       title: String,
      // you should fill the rest of this in
   });
  ```

1. Next let's create the `Book` model from the schema.  
  ```js
  var Book = mongoose.model('Book', BookSchema);
  ```

1. Finally we'll need to export Book from this **module** (that's this file).  You can export it at the very end of the file by doing:
  ```js
  var Book = mongoose.model('Book', BookSchema);

  module.exports = Book;
  ```

## 4. Wait a second.... what are modules :grey_question:

We've already provided a `models/index.js` for you to use.  If you take a look in there you should already see that it
  1. requires mongoose
  1. connects to a book-app database

`index.js` will import each model and export an object called `exports` with keys representing each of our models.  That way we can `require` the entire directory and get all of our models!  

1. Go ahead and import and export your `Book` model in `index.js`.
  ```js
  // models/index.js
  module.exports.Book = require("./book.js");
  ```
  Now if someone were to `require('./models')` they'd gain access to this database model.

    <details><summary>Here's a module example:</summary>


      ├── models
      │   ├── index.js
      │   ├── gargoyle.js
      │   ├── gnome.js
      │   ├── goblin.js


      Inside `index.js` we require each of the other files and export it as one object:

      // models/index.js
      var mongoose = require("mongoose");
      mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost/book-app");

      module.exports.Gargoyle = require("./gargoyle.js");
      module.exports.Goblin = require("./goblin.js");
      module.exports.Gnome = require("./gnome.js");

      In the end this means that when you require `./models` in `server.js` you get back an object like
        { Gargoyle: Model, Goblin: Model, Gnome: Model }

    </details>


## 5. Verifying that this is working

Take a quick look in `seed.js`.  You should see that it does a `require('./models');` and then later uses `db.Book.create` to load some data into the database.  (The insightful student will also note that it tries to clear the `book-app` database first by deleting all the records.)

**What's a seed-file you ask?**
> A seed file is a file used to load pre-made data into our database.  It let's us start-up our app without having to key in data each time.

1. Try running `node seed.js` in your terminal.
  If you're not seeing `created X books` then something might be going wrong.  

  <details><summary>Spoiler: book.js</summary>
  ```js
  var mongoose = require('mongoose'),
    Schema = mongoose.Schema;

  var BookSchema = new Schema({
    title: String,
    author: String,
    image: String,
    release_date: String
  });

  var Book = mongoose.model('Book', BookSchema);

  module.exports = Book;
  ```
  </details>

1. You can use robomongo to check out your database.  If you got an error message try to debug, and if you're stuck ask for help.  


## 6. Connecting the database to the server

Next we'll start to use our new model in `server.js`.

1. Go ahead and open `server.js`.  
1. Add the correct require statement to `server.js` to import your modules.  `var db = require('./models')`.  This should go near the top as part of the "SETUP and CONFIGURATION".
1. Now delete the hard-coded books array.  We'll start to replace each route with the correct code to use the database instead.  From now on when we want to get to a book we'll use mongoose methods and access `db.Books`.

1. Find the books index route and replace it with the following code:
  ```js
  app.get('/api/books', function (req, res) {
    // send all books as JSON response
    db.Book.find(function(err, books){
      if (err) { return console.log("index error: " + err); }
      res.json(books);
    });
  });
  ```

1. Restart your server and if you've successfully seeded your database you should see all the seeded books when you refresh the page.


## 7. Challenge!

On your own use the mongoose methods to replace the other `/api/books*` routes with mongoose commands.

Make sure you look back to the lecture notes for info on the most important methods like:
* find
* findOneAndRemove
* new
* save

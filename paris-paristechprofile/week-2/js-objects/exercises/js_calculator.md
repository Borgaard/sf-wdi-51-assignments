### JavaScript Calculator (30 Mins)

Your task is to create a JavaScript object that represents a calculator. It should have methods that provide it with the following functionality...

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Exponents (Hint: Look up JavaScript's Math object)
* An operation of your choice!

You should be able to run these methods like so from your browser's Javascript console...
```js
calculator.add(1,2);
// => 3
```

### Bonus 1

Give your calculator memory and allow it to persist the result of multiple operations.
* Store this result in a `value` property.
* Give your calculator a `clear` method that resets `value`.

For example:

```js
calculator.add(1)
// value is 1
calculator.add(2)
// value is 3
calculator.add(2)
// value is 5
calculator.multiply(2)
// value is 10
```

### Bonus 2

Give your calculator a "master" method that can parse through a string of operations (e.g., `(2 - 1) * (5 ^ 2)`).
* Your calculator should still have memory.

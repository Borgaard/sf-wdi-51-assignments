### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*
- Use layout techniques with width, min-width, max-width, vh and vw.
- Understand and apply Image Optimization techniques such as min-width, max-width, retina display, etc.
- Identify breakpoints and apply media queries to adjust layout.
- Understand the difference between mobile-up and desktop-down CSS.
- Effectively use media queries to adjust and adapt your page layouts.
- Understand how media queries work in the cascade.
- Understand that Responsive Design is dictated by visual break points and not device sizes.

## Introduction: Responsive Design

Responsive Design is the strategy of making a site that "responds" to the browser and device on which it's being displayed. This means a website is usable, readable, and looks great on any and all screen sizes.

According to the Wikipedia definition:

"Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience — easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling — across a wide range of devices (from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors)."

### Responsive Design is _**not**_ Device-Specific

A responsive site doesn't just look good on the newest phone, watch, tablet, or mega-screen; it looks good on *any* screen. This might seem impossible, but it's relatively straightforward. All that's required is writing a series of rules, known as media queries, that check the size of the browser/device on which the site is being viewed, and adjust the CSS as needed.

### Media Queries

Media queries are conditional style rules for the size of the browser/device rendering the site. Let's look at an example.

We already know that if we do something like this:

```css
p {
  color: red;
}

p.blue_text {
  color: blue;
}
```

By default, all p tags will have red text – unless they have the class blue_text, in which case the text will be blue. We can do a similar thing with media queries.

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  p {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

Now all p tags will be red until the screen size reaches 600px, when they'll turn blue. How do we determine the pixel width to use in the media query?

### Breakpoints

The best approach to identifying the size of a media query is to test your site for breakpoints. A breakpoint is simply a specific browser width where the layout either breaks or no longer follows the intended design. Another way to think about it: The design looks 'off' or just plain bad!

You can use Chrome Dev Tools to measure the width of a page open in the browser. Adjust the width of the browser and identify breakpoints. If you see an unintended or unacceptable change in design/layout, your media query should be set to the width of the browser when the change occurs. These numbers will not typically be 'nice' or even something like `1050px`, but more likely seem random (like `527px`).

What else do we need to get started?

### The Viewport Meta Tag!
We've seen some problems that can happen if we don't override some of the initial properties of a website. One of the properties we need to override is the viewport:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

This ensures that the viewport is the same as the screen, and displays at a natural zoom of 100%.

If you don't include this tag, the browser gets to choose the default viewport width and will not adhere to the correct media query style rules. In other words, a mobile browser might set its viewport width to `1080px` and display the layout meant for a screen that size.

Here's an example of a site that hasn't overridden the viewport: [http://www.tcgplayer.com](http://www.tcgplayer.com)

## Demo / Codealong: Responsive Design 

So how can we make more impactful changes to our site using media queries? The `flexbox` approach to layout eliminated the need to use media queries to adjust the grid on your page. But what if you're working on a project with existing code using `float`? And what about adjusting other elements on the page using media queries? It's important to understand all methods when approaching responsive design.

Consider this [HTML](codealong/albums/index.html) and [CSS](codealong/albums/main-1.css), which renders like this on a large screen:
![albums-1](assets/albums-1.png)

And like this on a small screen:
![albums-1-400](assets/albums-1-400.png)

The issues with the layout in the smaller screen rendering are evident, from the top of the page to the bottom:
- The `nav` takes up too much vertical space.
- The title and description are too large.
- The 6-column layout is too narrow for the content.

It's important that we work "big to small" – meaning we address the large layout concerns first, then work through the details of adjusting sizing. We also have to keep in mind that there may be some breakpoints in between a common desktop size and a common mobile size. For now, let's work on adding styles for a small screen size at `400px`.

One way to approach media queries is to start by adding in styles you want for the smaller size *at the end of your CSS document*. These styles will overwrite the rules above! Compare this [new CSS](codealong/albums/main-2.css) to the [previous CSS](codealong/albums/main-1.css) and see how it renders on a large screen:
![albums-2](assets/albums-2.png)

All content on the page is aligned in a single column, whether viewed on a small or large screen width. Now we need to specify **at which width** we want these styles to be applied. We can do this by adding in media queries to our [updated CSS](codealong/albums/main-3.css).

Here are the four different layouts as we reduce the screen size:
![albums-1](assets/albums-1.png)
![albums-3-med](assets/albums-3-med.png)
![albums-3-sm](assets/albums-3-sm.png)
![albums-3-xs](assets/albums-3-xs.png)

Now our layout looks great on all screen sizes! The final touch is to adjust the copy on the page. Here's the [final CSS](codealong/albums/main-4.css) and how it renders on a small screen:
![albums-4](assets/albums-4.png)

You can access all of the code [here](codealong/albums).

## Independent Practice: Dream Team 
Take a look at the following mockup. 

Choose a Dream Team of 3-4 fellow students and work together to wireframe out what the site should look like when it's responsive.

Start by wireframing a mobile version of the site. If you have time, wireframe a tablet version of the site.

As you wireframe, it may be helpful to consider the following questions:

1. Is there any content that might not be necessary to display on smaller devices?
2. What content needs to be visible?
	- For example, is it necessary to show the entire nav if there are other ways of getting to navigation? 
3. Identify any extra styling.
	- Can we simplify some of the styles a bit for smaller devices, while still maintaining the same look and feel for the site?

Have each group present their wireframes and describe why they made the choices they did.

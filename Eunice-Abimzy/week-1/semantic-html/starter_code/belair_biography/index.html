        <a href="#">In West Philadelphia</a>, born and raised, on the playground is where I spent most of my days:
        <ul>
          <li>Chilling out</li>
          <li>Maxing</li>
          <li>Relaxing, all cool</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        I was shooting some b-ball outside of the school when a couple of guys - they were up to <strong>no good</strong> - started making trouble in my neighborhood.

        I got in <em>one little fight</em> and my mom got scared. She said, <blockquote>"You'll move in with your Aunt and your Uncle in Bel-Air."</blockquote>

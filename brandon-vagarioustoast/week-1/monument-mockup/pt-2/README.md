## Exercise

In this homework assignment, you will continue to build out Monument Lifestyle Magazine's blog page. You'll be updating the layout using padding, margin, borders, and flexbox.

#### Requirements

- Use flexbox in your CSS to achieve a two-column layout.
- Use `inline-block` to align elements next to one another (e.g., anchors in the nav).
- Add a background image to the header.
- Use [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icons for Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram in the footer.
- Use indentation in your HTML and CSS files to make your code readable.
- Use [HTML](https://html5.validator.nu/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) validators to check for errors before submitting.
- Include [browser prefixes](http://pleeease.io/play/) to make sure that newer CSS properties render consistently in different browsers.

#### Bonus Tasks
- Google and implement Google Fonts (Fonts are specified in bonus mockup below).
- Make the nav "sticky" (fixed) as the user scrolls.
- Add a hover effect to the links and buttons using pseudo-classes.


#### Starter Code
You will continue working on the project you started last night.

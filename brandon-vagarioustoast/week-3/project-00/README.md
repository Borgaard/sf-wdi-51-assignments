### Portfolio Site

This is my personal portfolio. Still under construction but ready to be seen nonetheless.

### Technologies

-HTML, CSS, JS. The layout is a mix of custom styles mixed with Materialize CSS. Most of the functionality is a product of Materialize, as their functions are so handy.

### Approach

There was no singular, directed approach. I started with the basic structure, wanting to get it close to [this](https://whatisjasongoldstein.com/), but I diverged a bit when it came to the sections after the intro.

I jumped between styling and structure and likely wasted a lot of time, though I had a lot of fun experimenting.

I like simple color schemes, and prefer a mix of black and white with another color for highlighting. I'm no Gerome, but I do what I can.

### Unsolved Problems

-If you scroll far enough to have both the "code" and "contact" sections on the screen and then click an item from the code carousel, the contact form will show through the lightbox overlay. This also happens with the "testimonials" section.

-Could not get my image to keep a decent size when resizing below 500px, so I hid it for now.

### Difficulties

-Trying to manually override Materialize styles. This was a headache because a lot is happening behind the scenes in this library. This helped me learn to use the elements tab in the Dev tools a lot.

-Getting the hamburger menu to show up. I realized later I had to have it outside of my navbar ul tag to have it show.

## Learning Objectives
- Use CSS to style a web page according to a mockup.

## Introduction
Working from a mockup will be part of your daily routine as a web developer. Mockups and specs — details about white space, size, color, and more — can vary depending on your designer. It's important to be incredibly detail-oriented when following a mockup, so be sure to communicate with your designer to clarify your needs. It may take time before you agree on the best way to share materials.

## Exercise
Using the provided HTML, add the CSS necessary to make the page resemble the mockup below.

#### Requirements
- You will not need to make any edits to the HTML.
- Don't leave anything on the page unstyled — even if your CSS isn't perfect.

**BONUS**

- Add hover effects to the nav.
- Imagine how you might use the `border` property to eliminate the need for the `|` characters in the nav.

<h1>My Life and Times</h1>
<h2>By Justin Cullen</h2><header></header>
<p><strong><a>In West Philadelphia</a></strong> born and raised, on the playground is where I spend most of my days:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Chilling out</li>
  <li>Maxing</li>
  <li>Relaxing</li>
</ul>
<p>I was shooting some bball outside of the school when a couple of guys-they
  were up to <strong>no good</strong> started making trouble in my neighborhood.</p>

  <p>I got in <em>one little fight</em> and my mom got scared she said,</p>
  "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air"</p>

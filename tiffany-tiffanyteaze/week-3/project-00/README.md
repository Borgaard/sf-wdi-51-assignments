*Technologies used.*
1. Carousel = Bootstrap
2. Carousel Lightbox = Bootstrap
3. Nav Links jump to page content = HTML
4. Scroll highlights section of page in nav = jQuery
5. Testimonials rotate in and out = quovolver jQuery plugin
6. Hamburger mobile nav = Bootstrap
7. Contact form = Bootstrap

*Your process/approach.*
There are so many resources online for the requirements of the project, so my approach was to find tutorials and examples of each component and build from that. For the scroll highlights, I reached out for help from Leo.

*Unsolved problems.*
I want to refactor the nav link jumps and scroll highlights with Bootstrap's scrollspy to get a smooth scroll and to resolve the issue with the top of sections jumping behind the nav bar. I also need to prevent the height of my testimonials from collapsing every time a quote fades out. There's also some alignment issues with my about section and contact form. I also want to get PHP mail setup on my contact form and add a reCAPTCHA.

*Your biggest wins and challenges.*
This was the most fun project I've worked on so far. My best friend is a graphic designer, so I reached out to her to provide the design, and we had so much fun building this page together. When we were 13, a mutual friend sent her my GeoCities fan page I had built of Brand New's song Guernica with IFrames and MS Paint graphics. It made her think I was really cool, and we became friends from that. She made a Slack channel for us and learned how to use Sketch to help me, so this whole weekend has been very nostalgic!

How To Use This Repo
--------------------

This is the repository where you'll submit your homework.    
Follow these directions closely to switch over to this repository.

Setup (do this only once):
1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your ```~/code``` folder.
3. Create a directory in the ```sf-wdi-51-assignments``` folder using your real name and github account name. Example: ```sf-wdi-51-homework/nicole-Borgaard```. That will make it easier for us to remember everyone's GitHub username. :)

Submit homework assignments:
1. Create a folder for the current week in your personal directory. 
2. Add each assignment in the current week's folder. Example for homework in week 2: `sf-wdi-51-assignments/nicole-Borgaard/week_2/slackBot/hubot.js`
3. `$ cd` to `sf-wdi-51-assignments`. To figure out where you are in terminal, `$ pwd` to find your present working directory.
4. `$ git add .` to stage files you'd like to commit and push to GitHub.
5. `$ git commit -m "adding week 2 slackBot assignment"` to add a descriptive comment about what you're doing. Comments are a requirement of the commit command.
6. `$ git push origin master` to push your local code to your personal remote repository on GitHub.
7. Your homework is now located on your personal repo (`yourUsername/sf-wdi-51-assignments`). Create a pull request to the homework repo (`Borgaard/sf-wdi-51-assignments`) to submit your assignment.


This is how your local homework directory should be structured:


    |-- code/
        |-- sf-wdi-51-resources/ (cloned from Github)
        |-- sf-wdi-51-homework/ (cloned from Github)
            |-- firstName-githubUsername/
                |-- week_1/
                    |-- bottleApp/
                        |-- bottlesOfBeer.js
                        |-- index.html
                    |-- spontaneousTravelApp/
                        |-- randomAddressGenerator.js
                |-- week_2/
                    |-- hubot/
                        |-- hubot.js
                |-- week_3/
                |-- week_4/
                |-- week_5/
